Ah, I see the issue 👌

The key point: **DocuSign embedded signing URLs (Recipient View URLs)** are **one-time use only**.

* Once you open it in an iFrame or browser, DocuSign consumes that URL.
* When that signing session ends (or when you try to reuse it), DocuSign will not load another document — it will immediately **redirect to the `returnUrl`**.
* That’s why in your case, when you try to load multiple documents in multiple iFrames, you just see the redirect URL.

### Why this happens

* DocuSign expects the signer to complete **all documents in the envelope in one session**.
* If you try to break it up into multiple parallel iFrames, each signing URL is already “used,” so it redirects.

### Correct approaches

1. **Multiple documents in one envelope** ✅

   * Add all the docs into **one envelope**.
   * DocuSign will show them in sequence in the same signing ceremony.
   * One embedded signing URL is enough.

2. **Multiple envelopes (separate docs)** ✅

   * If you *must* keep them separate, create a new envelope for each doc.
   * For each envelope, generate a fresh `RecipientViewRequest` (embedded signing URL).
   * You cannot open them all at once in iFrames. Instead:

     * Open one → signer signs → redirect to your app → load next signing URL → repeat.

⚠️ There’s **no way to load multiple envelopes/documents in parallel iFrames** with DocuSign — the system enforces one session per recipient view.

👉 To fix your case:

* If your requirement is *“user signs multiple docs in one go”* → put them in **one envelope**.
* If your requirement is *“user signs them separately”* → you’ll need to **chain multiple signing sessions**, not multiple iFrames.

Do you want me to draft a **C# sample flow** for chaining multiple signing URLs (one after another) so the signer completes all documents in sequence without confusion?
